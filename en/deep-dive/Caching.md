# Caching

## What is Caching?

- A mechanism that `stores data or results in advance` so that they can be `accessed or reused more quickly` later.

## Advantages of Caching

- Data stored in the cache is located in a `faster storage area`, so it can be `accessed more quickly` than fetching data directly from the original source.
- When there are many `repeated accesses to the same data`, using a cache can `reduce system load` compared to accessing the original data storage every time.
- Caching can also `reduce network traffic` by fetching data from the cache instead of the original data source.

## Examples of Caching Usage

- A `web browser` caches images, scripts, and style sheets of web pages in a local storage so that the next time the same page is visited, it loads faster.
- Caching is used in both `hardware and software`, such as memory caches in programming, database query result caches, and web page caches in browsers.
