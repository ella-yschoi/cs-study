# Interrupt

<br/>

## What is an Interrupt?

- An **event generated by hardware or software** in a computer system.
- Interrupts suspend the current program's flow and **allow the system to handle another event or operation**.
- Interrupts are used to manage **system responsiveness** and **multitasking**.

## When Do Interrupts Occur?

### Hardware Interrupt

- Generated by external hardware devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, timer, etc.) when they need attention.
- Through this, the system can interact with the device or perform necessary operations.

### Software Interrupt

- Explicitly generated by a program, or by exceptional situations (e.g., division by zero, memory access error, etc.).
- Used to handle abnormal program behavior or errors.

## Summary

- Interrupt handling is performed by the operating system or hardware.
- When an interrupt occurs, the currently executing operation is suspended, and the system handles the interrupt.
- Afterward, the previous operation may resume or switch to another operation.
- Interrupts are an important concept for maintaining system efficiency, responsiveness, and stability, and are supported by various operating systems and computer architectures.
